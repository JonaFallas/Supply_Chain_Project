# Supply Chain Project 

 
With a dataset of different products sold by a fashion and beauty startup, this analysis aims to illustrate the effect of various factors—such as profit, revenue, shipping, and manufacturing costs—on business performance by addressing the following questions: 

 
- Revenue generated and profit margin. 
- Revenue by product type. 
- Revenue and profit contributions by different locations. 
- Profit by different product types. 
- Costliest products to produce. 
- Products with the highest defect rates. 
- Correlation between the highest defect rates and suppliers. 
- Total manufacturing cost by product type. 
- How different transportation modes affect total cost. 
- How different routes also affect total costs.
